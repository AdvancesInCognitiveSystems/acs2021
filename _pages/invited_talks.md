- **Day 2:** [Ute Schmid](https://advancesincognitivesystems.github.io/acs/speakers/ute_schmid) [Head of the Cognitive Systems Group, University of Bamberg](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/gerd-gigerenzer)
    **Title:** Reconciling knowledge-based and data-driven AI for human-in-the-loop machine learning__

    **Abstract:** For many practical applications of machine learning it is appropriate or even necessary to make use of human expertise to compensate a too small amount or low quality of data. Taking into account knowledge which is available in explicit form reduces the amount of data needed for learning. Furthermore, even if domain experts cannot formulate knowledge explicitly, they typically can recognize and correct erroneous decisions or actions. This type of implicit knowledge can be injected into the learning process to guide model adapation. These insights have led to the so-called third wave of AI with a focus on explainablity (XAI). In the talk, I will
introduce research on explanatory and interactive machine learning. I will present inductive programming as a powerful approach to learn interpretable models in relational domains. Arguing for the need of specific exlanations for different stakeholders and goals, I will introduce different types of explanations based on theories and findings from cognitive science. Furthermore, I will show how intelligent tutor systems and XAI can be combined to support constructive learning. Algorithmic realisations of explanation generation will be complemented with results from psychological experiments investigating the effect on joint human-AI task performance and trust. Finally, current research projects are introduced to illustrate applications of the presented work in medical diagnostics, quality control in industrial production, file management, and accountability.

- **Day 3:**  [Anthony Cohn](https://advancesincognitivesystems.github.io/acs/speakers/Anthony_Cohn),  [Professor of Automated Reasoning, University of Leeds](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/76/professor-anthony-g-cohn-freng-ceng-citp)
