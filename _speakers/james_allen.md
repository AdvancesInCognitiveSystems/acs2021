title: "Conversational systems: Past, Present and Future" 
bio: James Allen is the  John H. Dessauer Professor of Computer Science at the University of Rochester and also an Associate Director and a Senior Researcher at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, FL. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto and was a recipient of the Presidential Young Investigator award from NSF in 1984. Dr. Allen is an international leader in the areas of natural language understanding and collaborative human-machine interaction. A Founding Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), he was editor-in-chief of the journal Computational Linguistics from 1983-1993. He was general chair of the Second International conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation held in Boston in 1991, and the Fourth International Conference on AI Planning Systems in Pittsburgh in 1999.  Dr. Allenâ€™s research concerns defining computational models of intelligent collaborative and conversational agents that can interact effectively with humans in a wide range of problem solving and analysis tasks. This body of research is unique in its focus on combining what are often treated as separate fields in Artificial Intelligence, including knowledge representation and reasoning, language understanding, planning, intention recognition and learning.  He is particularly interested in the overlap between natural language understanding and reasoning. While most of the NLP field has moved to statistical learning methods as the paradigm for language processing, he believes that deep language understanding can only currently be achieved by significant hand-engineering of semantically-rich formalisms coupled with statistical preferences. The TRIPS project is a long-term effort to build generic technology for dialogue systems (both spoken and 'chat' systems), which has been pursued for several decades. This includes broad-coverage domain-general natural language processing, dialogue agents built using models of collaborative problem solving, dynamic context-sensitive language modeling, and a rich engineering framework for building dialogue systems in new domains.
